     mini_sendmail - accept email on behalf of real sendmail
                   version 1.3.9 of 19Oct2015

mini_sendmail reads its standard input up to an end-of-file and
sends a copy of the message found there to all of the addresses
listed.  The message is sent by connecting to a local SMTP server.
This means mini_sendmail can be used to send email from inside a
chroot(2) area.

See the manual entry for more details.

To build: If you're on a SysV-like machine (which includes old Linux systems
but not new Linux systems), edit the Makefile and uncomment the SYSV_LIBS
line.  Otherwise, just do a make.

After it's built, you must test it to make sure your local sendmail
daemon is (a) running and (b) accepting local mail for delivery
elsewhere.  Here's what a successful test run might look like:

    % echo 'Subject: test' | ./mini_sendmail -v jef@mail.acme.com
    <<<< 220 gate.acme.com ESMTP Sendmail; Thu, 16 Dec 1999 17:17:37 -0800 (PST)
    >>>> HELO localhost
    <<<< 250 gate.acme.com Hello localhost [127.0.0.1], pleased to meet you
    >>>> MAIL FROM:<jef@gate.acme.com>
    <<<< 250 <jef@gate.acme.com>... Sender ok
    >>>> RCPT TO:<jef@mail.acme.com>
    <<<< 250 <jef@mail.acme.com>... Recipient ok
    >>>> DATA
    <<<< 354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself
    <<<< 250 RAA58877 Message accepted for delivery
    >>>> QUIT
    <<<< 221 gate.acme.com closing connection
    % 

And here's an unsuccessful run where there's no local sendmail
daemon running:

    % echo 'Subject: test' | ./mini_sendmail -v jef@mail.acme.com
    ./mini_sendmail: connect: Connection refused
    %
